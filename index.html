                        I grew up in Rockville, and am currently located in Bethesda. In my free time, you may find me cooking or reading. I majored in economics, and studied actuarial science. <br>

                        After two years of working through online platforms, I've found that every student can do well in math. <br>
                        In general, I teach every class high school and below, but I accept students on a case by case basis as well.
                        The main focus is on improving grades, but I also try to get each student to see the 'why' behind the math, and set them up with study skills for the future. <br>
